# Experimental folder

This is optional, but highly recommended: create a folder for each tech spike/vertical, meaning every new tech should have a isolated proof-of-concept folder, which can contain as little as a LinqPad script, but often would contain a C# Console App, or just some HTML/JS/CSS stuff.

Please name the folders by technology and in a consistent manner, e.g. 'AzureEventHub' or 'CosmosDbTriggers' or 'CanvasPicCrop" or whatever.

The contents of this folder would *never* be the target of style checks via e.g. `SonarCube`.
