# Tools folder

This is optional, but highly recommended: a folder fr .e.g `Postman` files, or the place where you might commit **small** binaries for use in daily workflows. "Big" binaries (> 2MB, personal opinion) should still be put in azure storage and downloaded here via script.

Please name the folders by tool and with lowercase, e.g. `postman` or `redis`.
